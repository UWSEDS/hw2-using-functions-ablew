# HW2 - Using Functions

##### Grade: 4/7    

-3: Didn't show that the datafraom has at least 3 columns     
-0: It's not *wrong* to use an integer value to check if the types are what you expect, but this might not have been the most clear way of doing it.

-----

Create a python module (a file with extension ‘.py’) with the following functions:

1. (4 points) Find an on-line data source (e.g., from data.gov). Write python codes that read the on-line file and create a data frame that has at least 3 columns.

1. (3 points) Create the function test_create_dataframe that takes a pandas DataFrame as input and returns True if the following conditions hold:

   1. The DataFrame contains only the columns that you specified in #1.
   1. The columns contain the correct data type
   1. There are at least 10 rows in the DataFrame.
